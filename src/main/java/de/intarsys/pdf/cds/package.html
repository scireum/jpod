<p>
CDS (Common Data Structure) defines higher level data structures or types on top
of COS types that are used all over the PDF spec.
</p>
<p>
Examples of such data structures that are no longer COS "primitives" 
(like strings and numbers) or "composites" (like arrays or dictionaries) but have 
already domain specific behavior are the date or rectangle object.
</p>
<p>
The CDS objects are implemented as wrappers on COS objects. Every change is 
reflected immediately in the implementation (COS) layer and vice versa.

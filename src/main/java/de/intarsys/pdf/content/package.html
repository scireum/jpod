The "content" package contains functionality to work on PDF content streams. 
Content streams are the PDF way of expressing page or form visual content, expressed 
using the PDF content stream operators.
<p>
Content streams define a page or form content, implemented using COSStreams 
with a specific format. The stream data is built using a sequence of content
stream operators. The stream dictionary additionally contains resources 
referenced by these operators.
</p>
<p>
This package contains higher level abstractions of the COSStream representing 
a content stream, CSContent, CSOperation and CSOperator.
</p>
<p>
A list of all known CSOperators is provided with CSOperators.
</p>
<p>
A framework for interpreting content streams is provided with ICSInterpreter and
ICSDevice.

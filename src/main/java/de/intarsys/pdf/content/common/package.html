Some common implementations on PDF content stream. 
<p>
This is not yet application level but also not pure "specification" level, 
so we put it here.

The most interesting class is PCContentStreamCreator, allowing to create 
CSContent via high level API calls. This class is used throughout the PDF
implementation for clean content construction and even higher level
tasks, for example when it comes to cross rendering from HTML.
